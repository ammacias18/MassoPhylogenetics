>Bootstrap method with heuristic search:
>  Number of bootstrap replicates = 1000
>  Starting seed = 523
>  Number of characters resampled in each replicate = 610
>  Optimality criterion = parsimony
>    Character-status summary:
>      Of 610 total characters:
>        All characters are of type 'unord'
>        All characters have equal weight
>        477 characters are constant (proportion = 0.781967)
>        25 variable characters are parsimony-uninformative
>        Number of parsimony-informative characters = 108
>    Gaps are treated as "missing"
>  Starting tree(s) obtained via stepwise addition
>    Addition sequence: random
>    Number of replicates = 3
>    Starting seed = 2334
>      Random trees (not just addition sequence) used as starting point
>    Number of trees held at each step = 1
>  Branch-swapping algorithm: tree-bisection-reconnection (TBR) with reconnection limit = 8
>    Steepest descent option not in effect
>  Initial 'Maxtrees' setting = 1000 (will be auto-increased by 100)
>  Branches collapsed (creating polytomies) if maximum branch length is zero
>  'MulTrees' option in effect
>  No topological constraints in effect
>  Trees are unrooted
>
>  1000 bootstrap replicates completed
>  Time used = 8.81 sec (CPU time = 9.02 sec)
