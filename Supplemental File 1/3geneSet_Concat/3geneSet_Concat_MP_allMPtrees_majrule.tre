>      Of 1976 total characters:
>        All characters are of type 'unord'
>        All characters have equal weight
>        1328 characters are constant (proportion = 0.672065)

>    Gaps are treated as "missing"
>    Multistate taxa interpreted as uncertainty
>  Starting tree(s) obtained via stepwise addition

>    Starting seed = 86233
>      Random trees (not just addition sequence) used as starting point

>  Branches collapsed (creating polytomies) if maximum branch length is zero
>  'MulTrees' option in effect
