>Bootstrap method with heuristic search:
>  Number of bootstrap replicates = 1000
>  Starting seed = 4621
>  Number of characters resampled in each replicate = 449
>  Optimality criterion = parsimony
>    Character-status summary:
>      Of 449 total characters:
>        All characters are of type 'unord'
>        All characters have equal weight
>        240 characters are constant (proportion = 0.534521)
>        71 variable characters are parsimony-uninformative
>        Number of parsimony-informative characters = 138
>    Gaps are treated as "missing"
>  Starting tree(s) obtained via stepwise addition
>    Addition sequence: random
>    Number of replicates = 3
>    Starting seed = 927
>      Random trees (not just addition sequence) used as starting point
>    Number of trees held at each step = 1
>  Branch-swapping algorithm: tree-bisection-reconnection (TBR) with reconnection limit = 8
>    Steepest descent option not in effect
>  Initial 'Maxtrees' setting = 1000 (will be auto-increased by 100)
>  Branches collapsed (creating polytomies) if maximum branch length is zero
>  'MulTrees' option in effect
>  No topological constraints in effect
>  Trees are unrooted
>
>  1000 bootstrap replicates completed
>  Time used = 5.43 sec (CPU time = 5.62 sec)
