>  Optimality criterion = parsimony
>    Character-status summary:
>      Of 876 total characters:
>        All characters are of type 'unord'
>        All characters have equal weight
>        651 characters are constant (proportion = 0.743151)
>        56 variable characters are parsimony-uninformative
>        Number of parsimony-informative characters = 169
>    Gaps are treated as "missing"
>    Multistate taxa interpreted as uncertainty
>  Starting tree(s) obtained via stepwise addition
>    Addition sequence: random
>    Number of replicates = 1000
>    Starting seed = 7582
>      Random trees (not just addition sequence) used as starting point
>    Number of trees held at each step = 1
>  Branch-swapping algorithm: tree-bisection-reconnection (TBR) with reconnection limit = 8
>    Steepest descent option not in effect
>  Initial 'Maxtrees' setting = 1000 (will be auto-increased by 100)
>  Branches collapsed (creating polytomies) if maximum branch length is zero
>  'MulTrees' option in effect
>  No topological constraints in effect
>  Trees are unrooted
>
>Heuristic search completed
>  Total number of rearrangements tried = 1309642
>  Score of best tree(s) found = 338
>  Number of trees retained = 2
>  Time used = 0.42 sec (CPU time = 0.44 sec)
